# games-core
A core library to help implement two players games

## TODO
- Adds links under maven and license badges
* Probably it should be better to force evaluation functions to return short instead of integer and makes Evaluator responsible for the computation of mat evaluations
* Implement transposition table to increase search depth, in AI and PerfT
* Write tests and Documentation ;-)
* Test with Sonar
* Publish artifact on Maven central
